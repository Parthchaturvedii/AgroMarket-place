# 🌾 AgroMarket – E-Farming Marketplace

AgroMarket is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The platform connects farmers directly with customers through a digital marketplace, reducing dependency on intermediaries and improving transparency in agricultural trade.Users can register and log in securely, browse available farm products, add items to a shopping cart, and manage their selections before purchase. The dashboard displays products with pricing details, while the cart page calculates total cost dynamically and allows item removal. User sessions and cart data are maintained using localStorage, and user credentials are stored in MongoDB through RESTful APIs.
This project demonstrates full-stack development concepts including authentication, routing, state management, API integration, and database connectivity. AgroMarket serves as a foundational e-commerce model tailored for agricultural use cases and can be extended with payment gateways, admin product management, order tracking, and cloud deployment for real-world scalability.
